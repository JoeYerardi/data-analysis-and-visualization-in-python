# Data Analysis and Visualization in Python
This repository serves as a demonstration of how to import csv files containing Census Bureau population data, reformat, analyze and join that data with a shapefile using Pandas and then visualize and map the data using Matplotlib and Folium.

The demonstration script is in a Jupyter notebook (population_change.ipynb). The csv files used in the notebook can be found in  this repository's data folder. The shapefile used in the notebook can be downloaded [here](https://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/geo/shapefiles/index.php).
